# Backend Assessment

## Setup

### Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

### Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

Open http://localhost:3000

Objective:
You will be working on a project where you need to implement and connect backend functionality with a front-end dashboard. Your goal is to complete the CRUD operations for students and ensure the front-end interacts seamlessly with the backend.
What you need to do:
1.	Clone the repository provided below.
2.	Follow the instructions in the README file to set up the project locally.
3.	Implement the required backend endpoints.
4.	Integrate the front-end dashboard with your backend endpoints.
5.	Add an Edit Student feature.
6.	Test your functionality to ensure it works as expected.
Notes for the Candidate
•	Backend uses Express (or NestJS if preferred) with REST endpoints:
o	GET /students – list all students
o	POST /students – add a new student
o	PUT /students/:id – edit a student
o	DELETE /students/:id – delete a student
•	Frontend uses React + TypeScript + Tailwind, hooked up to the backend API via api.ts.
•	Database can be SQLite, Postgres, or even an in-memory store for simplicity.
•	README.md in the root should include setup instructions:
o	cd backend && npm install && npm run dev
o	cd frontend && npm install && npm start
o	Open frontend on localhost:3000 and test CRUD.

Assessment Guidelines:
•	You have 3 hours to complete the task.
•	You may use any resources or documentation, but the work must be your own.
•	Please commit your work regularly and push your final solution to the repo.
